# DeViBench: The first benchmark evaluates how video quality affects MLLM accuracy.

This repository maintains the **DeViBench** (**De**graded **Vi**deo Understanding **Bench**mark) from the HotNets paper **"Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI"**.

*The benchmark is continuously growing, and we are considering transforming all existing Streaming Video Understanding Benchmarks to the "DeViBench style".

## üìÅ Dataset Content

The dataset file `datasets.csv` contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sample_folder` | Corresponding video ID. This dataset uses the same video files as the [StreamingBench Real-Time Visual Understanding](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mjuicem/StreamingBench/tree/main) dataset, available for download from the provided link. |
| `start_time` | Start time of the video segment. Questions refer to a 5-second segment starting from this timestamp. |
| `question` | The question content. |
| `options` | Available options for the question. |
| `standard_answer` | Standard answer to the question. |
| `task_type` | Task type of the question. |
