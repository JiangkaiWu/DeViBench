# DeViBench: The first benchmark evaluates how video quality affects MLLM accuracy.

This repository maintains the **DeViBench** (**De**graded **Vi**deo Understanding **Bench**mark) from the HotNets paper **"Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI"**.

*The benchmark is continuously growing, and we are considering transforming more existing Streaming Video Understanding Benchmarks to the "DeViBench style".

## üìÅ Dataset Content

The dataset file `datasets.csv` contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sample_folder` | Corresponding video ID. This dataset uses the same video files as the [StreamingBench Real-Time Visual Understanding](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mjuicem/StreamingBench/tree/main) dataset, available for download from the provided link. |
| `start_time` | Start time of the video segment. Questions refer to a 5-second segment starting from this timestamp. |
| `question` | The question content. |
| `options` | Available options for the question. |
| `standard_answer` | Standard answer to the question. |
| `task_type` | Task type of the question. |


The prompt format for asking questions:
```
You are a multiple-choice question answering assistant.
Your task is to output only the letter of the correct option, without any explanation or extra text.
Question:
[Question]
Options:
[Options]
```

## üì• Data Download

Video files can be downloaded from:

> https://huggingface.co/datasets/mjuicem/StreamingBench/tree/main

Please match the video files with the corresponding `sample_folder` in `datasets.csv`.

## üìä Distribution of our generated QA samples

* (B) Gradually becomes more negative 

* (C) Fluctuates between -1 and -2 

* (D) Gradually becomes less negative

**Standard Answer**: B

**Answer from 200 kbps**: D

**Answer from 2000 kbps**: B

## üîß How to improve accuracy?
Please refer to our HotNets paper for context-aware video streaming. Our method allocates more bits to chat-important regions (e.g., purple circles) and fewer bits to chat-irrelevant regions (e.g., yellow circles), thus improving MLLM accuracy.

<div style="text-align: center;">

To achieve fine-grained QP control, we adopt H.265 implemented by [Kvazaar](https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Jermmy/pytorch-quantization-demo.svg?style=flat&label=Star) to encode ours and baseline. Except for the QP values, ours and baseline use the same encoding parameters. 

The specific Kvazaar command lines are as follows:

```bash
kvazaar -i {input.yuv} --input-res={resolution} --gop 0 --period 0 --input-fps {fps} --qp {qp} [--roi roi.txt] -o {output.mp4}
```

Where the fps remains the same as the original video. The resolution gradually decreases as the bitrate decreases. For example, we set 1920√ó1080 for 800 Kbps, 1600√ó900 for 600 Kbps, 1280√ó720 for 400 Kbps, and 1024√ó576 for 200 Kbps. --roi is optional and is only used in our method. Both our method and the baseline achieve the target bitrates by adjusting --qp.
